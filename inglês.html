                    and code) simultaneously. This allows AI to analyze a live broadcast, hold a real-time spoken
                    conversation without lag, and even begin executing complex tasks autonomously, such as scheduling
                    meetings or debugging software.</p>

                    challenges. Our research focuses on "Aquaculture 4.0," a field that merges biology and technology.
                    We use IoT sensors to monitor water quality in real-time, AI to optimize feeding, and biotechnology
                    to ensure fish health, creating a more productive and ecological system.</p>

                    where data is the most important seed. By applying AI, soil sensors, and drones for aerial mapping,
                    we transform decision-making in the field. The goal is clear: to maximize productivity, optimize the
                    use of resources (water and fertilizers), and ensure sustainable food production for the planet.</p>
